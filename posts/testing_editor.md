# Hello there!

I made this page a while ago to act as a dumping ground for my thoughts and an experiment in having a place away from social media to take space.

### This is an intentionally disorganized space.

I look back fondly on the old internet - it still exists, obviously, but it's been drowned out in terms of visibility by the silos that most people spend time in. We used to have anti-silos in the form of communities like Digg, StumbleUpon, and (early) reddit - they drove traffic around the internet outside what people would discover via google.

But you can directly connect the downfall of those kinds of social content aggregator with the tightening of apis granted to browser extensions.

## What I (want to) do to fix it:

### This.

Personal blogs need to come back, obviously. Weird websites that aren't meant to be digestible. Alternatives to the infinite feeds. 


### Multiple attempts to revive stumbleupon. 

Yes I know theboredbutton exists. Yes I know reddit is still a thing (but not really, its enshittification started a while back and now it's unusable because you can't seriously browse it without logging in), yes I know about cloudhiker. I even (started working on) my own thing, built as an updatable bookmarklet. You can find the scraps of it at [Catalyst/Inkwell](https://github.com/ShokuninNetwork/catalyst/tree/main/inkwell) (obviously unmaintained and broken atm). I strongly believe we need a lightweight and portable and p2p traffic router with the "addictability" of stumbleupon, but that is outside the control of any given corporate entity. I'll write something about the ideas behind inkwell someday. I'll get back to it someday. 


### Community discovery and curation > mindless endless unfiltered growth. 

My current project is a streamer overlay that summmarizes, filters, and collates chat into a digestible feed - a small handful of messages that are easier for a streamer to reason about.

My long term plan is for those messages to be handles for a streamer to curate their community: get raided? downvote the collated message and downweight everyone who participated in the raid. A bunch of users give you a great suggestion, but you don't notice it? upvote the collated message that brings it to your attention. I'd like donos/superchats to feel less like demands and more like requests - you can say "yeah! that's a good idea!" and reward the person who made it with additional weight in future discussions, or you can say "eww" and... do the opposite. If someone consistently acts in a way that isn't worth your attention, eventually they just wont be visible, no matter how much money they throw at you.

And that's a good thing - curation is good.

### End.

This post was written using a hacked together/vibecoded [editor UI](/editor). I am the kind of person who (unfortunately) doesn't do things unless they are easy, so I need to work to make things easier for myself, or else I will never do it. That includes something as simple as writing posts to this static website. I didn't want to host a backend somewhere, but I wanted to be able to post in my browser, so let's see if it worked!
